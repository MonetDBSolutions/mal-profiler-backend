Python MAL profiler backend
===========================

Introduction
============

This project is a library that parses MonetDB JSON profiling events
and stores them in a MonetDBLite-Python_. The user can then use SQL
queries to compile information about the queries that produced those
profiling events.

This is intended to be used as a back end of other programs like
Marvin, or Malcom.
